The Joda-Time Plugin integrates the "Joda-Time":http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/ date/time library into Grails. The plugin...

* Provides the ability to bind from form inputs to Joda Time fields on domain or command objects.
* Adds unit testing support for domain classes that use Joda Time properties.
* Supports JSON and XML rendering of Joda Time types.
* Provides tag-libs for input and output of Joda Time data.
* Enhances Grails' scaffolding to support domain classes with Joda Time fields.
* Adds compatibility and consistency methods to Joda Time types so that they integrate better with Groovy.
* Provides templates for rendering inputs using the [Fields plugin](http://freeside.co/grails-fields).

h2. Known Issues

* It is currently not possible to do certain types of criteria query with _DateTime_ properties mapped using _PersistentLocalDateTimeWithZone_ (or any other multi-column Hibernate UserType). Aggregate functions (max, min, avg, count, etc.) in projections will not work on such properties and neither will the _'between'_ criterion.
